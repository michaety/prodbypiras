## Code Comments & Documentation

All new code includes inline comments explaining:
- Component purpose
- Data flow
- Event handling
- State management
- User interaction patterns

Example:
```javascript
// Audio preview functionality with play/pause toggle and timeline (copied from shop page)
let currentAudio: HTMLAudioElement | null = null;
let currentButton: HTMLButtonElement | null = null;
let currentListingId: number | null = null;
```

## Responsive Design

All components are fully responsive:
- Mobile: Single column layouts, stacked cards
- Tablet: 2-column grids
- Desktop: 3-4 column grids
- Uses Tailwind CSS breakpoints (`md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`)

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Uses standard Web Audio API via WaveSurfer.js
- localStorage for promo tracking
- Clipboard API for copy functionality

## Testing Checklist

✅ Build completes without errors
✅ All routes resolve correctly
✅ Database queries execute properly
✅ Form validation works
✅ Audio playback functions
